        Hello friend !! :D I'll be direct and honest with you, I'm here to show you 
        a litle part of my life and tell you a few things about me !! yeah yea i know 
        what are you thinking, in the past i did a web page showing some hobbies 
        and things that  I really enjoy to do, but that was different,  wasn't 
        everything. So this time i want to be very clear and i wanna share with you
        these static pages that literally  are pieces of my life, my heart and soul
        :') (sometimes I'am the best poet jaja .... ok no :(  ).
    </p>
