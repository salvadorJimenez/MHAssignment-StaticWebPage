                    <p>As you can see at the moment that i send this task to the magmahackers slack, it's too late, the delivery date has passed and thats it a big problem with me, the most part of time i'm fail in the delivery dates of tasks and i know that is really importat be puntual but I think that i don't have enought motivation, in the last 6 years i worked in many areas here in colima, of course nothing relevant with software developing. And i can work in this area is the only that matters to me. Is the only thing that i really like to do. So i'm just waiting the moment to work with you . that is for sure. :)</p>
